# Simple neural network using MatLab

This is a simple feed-forward neural network using MATLAB with [Alarm](https://github.com/LetsAI/Simple-neural-network-using-MatLab/blob/master/Alarm.png) and [Warning](https://github.com/LetsAI/Simple-neural-network-using-MatLab/blob/master/Warning.png) situations. This implementation is to simplify the basic concept of a neural network and show what is happening during the matrices multiplication step by step. <br><br>
You can, of course, change the input parameters values, weights or biases and see what will you get<br>
* Below are the expected results: <br>
